#In this programming assignment you will need to implement in Python a bidirectional A* search algorithm to solve the problem of finding paths in navmeshes created from user-provided images. 

#The key components include:

Using Python to develop the pathfinding algorithm.

Handling input which includes a navmesh and outputting an image showing the path from a source to a destination point, both defined interactively.

Implementing the algorithm in a given template code (nm_pathfinder.py), and testing it using a provided program (nm_interactive.py).
